# ![Icono de la aplicaci√≥n](logo.png) Formulio

Empower developers to efficiently and effortlessly create form-based applications by designing the interface with XML templates and coding the application logic with JavaScript. Build your survey or data collection forms with minimal coding.

The application includes interface components to cover most cases that arise when implementing a data collection process. The framework uses a "context" system to access information consistently from different sources (database, files, REST APIs, device information, etc.) and supports automatic binding between entities retrieved from the repository and screen components. The refresh mechanism between components is based on a reactive mechanism, implemented from dependencies between screen components or between components and contexts.

Formulio also includes a configurable background process execution module called jayjobs, which allows defining steps to execute in JSON for tasks such as exporting data, synchronizing data with a remote REST API, etc.
